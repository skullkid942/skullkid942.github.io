A few years ago, when I became a parent, I knew it was time to pursue a real career. I was at a point in life where being a cashier wasn't going to cut it anymore. I really wanted something enjoyable and possibly technology related since I enjoy computers and games. I condidered my computer skills about average, so I expected programming to be out of the question. I was definitely interested in making software work the way I wanted it to though. 
After much research I decided on an Information Technology degree. So initially I enrolled in an online university. This turned out to be a trial and error process. I got to find out everything I don't like about technology. While the curriculum its self didn't turn out so well, I found that I really enjoyed my Java and HTML/CSS classes. The path was unclear, but I was fairly certain now that this was what I wanted to do. I got back on my path when I learned about coding bootcamps and the more interactive method of learning to code.
